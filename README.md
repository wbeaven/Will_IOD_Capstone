My capstone project is "Game Jam Hub", a game developer collaboration platform. You can create an account, assign yourself development roles, and create/join teams of other game developers. There is a search function for finding users that have the skills your team is missing, or finding teams that require the skills you can provide.

To install the project and get it running:

1. Download and extract root folder
2. In a coding IDE run "npm i" in both the front and backend
3. Run "npm run dev" in both the front and backend
4. Go to "http://localhost:5173/signin" in your browser
